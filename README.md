## General-Info

In this Small Project II IF2211 Algorithm Strategy, we aim to identify points that form a Bézier curve with predetermined starting points, control points, and end points, using the Divide and Conquer approach. In addition, we will compare the performance between the brute force algorithm and the Divide and Conquer algorithm in terms of execution time to determine the more efficient method. We also expand the capabilities of the Divide and Conquer algorithm to accept an unlimited number of control points (n control points), thus allowing the creation of more complex and flexible Bézier curves. As a result, the program we develop can solve various types of Bézier curves, from linear to quartic, using the adapted Divide and Conquer algorithm.

## How-To-Run

1.  Clone this repository :

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/AlbertChoe/Tucil2_13522081_13522113.git
    ```

2.  Navigate to the src directory:

    ```bash
    cd .\Tucil2_13522081_13522113\
    cd src
    python main.py
    ```

## How-To-Use

1. Run main.py to launch the GUI screen.
2. Input the control points in the format (x1,y1),(x2,y2),(xi,yi) without spaces, and the input should be integers.
3. Input the number of iterations to be performed on the control points.
4. Choose which algorithm you want to use (brute force or divide and conquer).
5. Click the "Plot Bezier Curve" button to generate the graph.
